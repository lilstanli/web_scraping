Task
----
Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

- How many months exist on Mars?
- How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
- What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
- Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
- Plot the results as a bar chart.
- Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
- Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
- Plot the results as a bar chart.
- About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
- Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
- Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
- Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.



Includes the following files:

1. "part_1_mars_news.ipynb" which is the solution to the first analysis.
2. "part_2_mars_weather.ipynb" which is the solution to the second analysis.
3. "csv_exports" folder which has the exported .csv file.
